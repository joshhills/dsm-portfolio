# Usage

## Quick-Start

How to get your own site hosted.

##Â Fresh Theme Installation

A partial Jekyll site with dummy information has already been generated. If you would prefer to make your own for whatever reason,
you can incorporate this theme by adding this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "dsm-portfolio"
```

And furthermore adding this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: dsm-portfolio
```

Finally, execute:

    $ bundle

Alternatively, you may install it using:

    $ gem install dsm-portfolio
